## Make Change Project

### First week homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This program simulates a cash transaction interface.

### How to run
At the start of the program, the user is prompted for two inputs: one for the total cost of an item(s), and a second for amount of cash tendered (received).
The program will return three possible outcomes:
1. An error message when the amount tendered was less than the total cost (customer didn't pay enough)
2. A message stating the exact change was tendered, so no money is due back to the customer.
3. If the customer is due money back, output the exact amount due back of each denomination (dollars and coins).
